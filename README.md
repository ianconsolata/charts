# Mysilio Charts

This is a simple set of charts we use for a variety of different open source projects.
__These charts are still under active development, and should not be relied on for production usage.__

# Releases

Charts are released using the package-and-deploy script in `src`, which builds the chart and copies them to the docs folder.

They are hosted using github pages at "https://mysilio-co.github.io/charts/"
